## Spring Boot + ActiveMQ example 

This is a small sample of how to send and consume messages using [Spring JMS](https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-jms/) to a Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.x (Apache ActiveMQ 5.x) broker. Use it as a reference for your own implementation.

### How to run the example

1. Edit the `src/main/resources/application.properties` and edit the correct url and broker credentials

2. Run the tests with the command `mvn test`
